LLL, Lucille Light transport Language
===============================================================================

What is LLL?
============

LLL(Lucille Light transport Language) is a shading language for raytracing-based renderers.

Compared to existing shading language such like RSL and MetaSL, LLL language spec is beautifully designed and naturally fits to raytracing-based global illumination renderers.

LLL is mainly designed for lucille renderer, but the LLL itself is applicable for all raytracing-based renderers.

We provide LLL language spec and its compiler as an opensource, but we do not disclose LLL runtime fully as an opensource.

Design phylosophy
=================

- Simple
- Beautiful
- Functional
- Fast execution(JIT, threaded, SIMD)
- Usable for both offline and realtime raytracing renderers.
